What?
	Hide inactive plugin allows you hide those buddies from buddy list who are not "Available."
	You can use this plugin to hide away, extended away, busy, idle buddies as well as those who are on mobile or listening to music. 

How?
	1. Apply the patch first. As the name suggest this patch is build against pidgin v 2.5.3. 
	2. Build pidgin 2.5.3 source. (check pidgin documentation on building instruction)
	4. copy .c file in $PIDGIN_HOME/pidgin/plugins directory.
	5. build plugin using command "make hide_inactive.so"

Where should I report a problem?
    Submit as a bug/issue on http://code.google.com/p/pidgin-plugins/ with
	   1. complete problem detail
	   2. steps to reproduce
	   3. pidgin log file (run pidgin with -d option and capture the complete output)
	   4. backtrace (check pidgin documentation on how to get backtrace)
	
More?
	Feel free. Questions & Suggestion will be answered as and when I'll have time.

Why no dll for windows?
	cause this plugin requires some changes in pidgin core, which means anyway you need to build pidgin on windows. 
	but don't worry too much, setting pidgin build environment on window is very easy and if you are on a decent internet connection, it would be much easier for you.
	Check pidgin site (pidgin.im) for details on how to build pidgin on windows (google->building pidgin on windows)

Enjoy,
