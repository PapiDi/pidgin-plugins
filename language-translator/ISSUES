KNOWN ISSUES

1. Plugin does not read the default language of pidgin evironment (loale on linux, PIDGINLANG on windows)
workaround: 
when plugin is enabled default global language is set to engligh unless otherwise changed. You can change global language to your selected languge using plugin configuration. 

2. Pidgin crashes while closing if some conversation is open.
workaround:
Problem with pidgin termination behaviour. conversation are closed without waiting for signals to finish. This causes pidgin to crash.
However this happens after buddy list, logs, prefs and every thing is saved. So not much loss there.

3. plugin replaces commands also. 
workaround:
currenty plugin does take care of conversation commands (like /help). but you can get the typed word by hitting backspace after the word is replaced.
